abstract: Over-the-top (OTT) services reach users via the open Internet without
  dedicated infrastructures and have experienced enormous growth in recent
  years. Netflix, an OTT streaming provider, now accounts for more than
  one-third of peak U.S. downstream traffic and causes cord-cutting of
  traditional cable pay-TV services from incumbent Internet service providers
  (ISPs). However, the service quality of video streaming is still influenced by
  the last-mile Internet access providers, who do not have incentives to deploy
  enough capacity and want to charge OTT service providers (OSPs) for direct
  connection. Although Netflix has reached deals with ISPs such as Comcast and
  Verizon to improve service quality, their undisclosed agreements have raised
  concerns about net neutrality. In this article, we study the economics of the
  Netflix-Comcast type of deals and derive the conditions under which an OSP and
  an ISP would reach such a deal. We analyze the impact of a deal transaction on
  the revenue of providers, the utility of users and the social welfare. Based
  on these results, we further classify different policy regimes and draw
  regulatory implications that depend on the intensity of ex-post deal
  competition and the cost of the deal. Our results can help understand how
  existing deals were made, how future deals might emerge, and how regulators
  should respond to various market conditions and scenarios.
