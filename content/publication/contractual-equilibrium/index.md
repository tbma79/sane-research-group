abstract: Driven by the rapid growth of content traffic and the demand for
  service quality, Internet content providers (CPs) have started to bypass
  transit providers and connect with access providers directly via private
  peering agreements. This peering relationship often raises disputes, e.g.,
  Netflix vs. Comcast, and is not well understood. In this paper, we build a
  peering contract model and propose the concept of contractual equilibrium,
  based on which we study the formation and evolution of peering contracts. By
  using market data, we emulate the strategic peering behavior of providers and
  shed light on the understanding of private peering agreements. We reveal that
  the superiority and market dominance of providers primarily determine their
  peering strategies. We show that 1) superior providers tend to engage in
  peering more aggressively, and 2) non-dominant CPs' optimal peering strategies
  are negatively correlated due to market cannibalism, while the dominant CP
  often behaves oppositely. Our findings help explain phenomena such as why
  Netflix and Comcast signed the first peering contract, and reason whether
  private peering contracts will strengthen in future.
