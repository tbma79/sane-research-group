abstract: As the Internet continues to evolve, traditional peering agreements
  cannot accommodate the changing market conditions. Premium peering has emerged
  where access providers (APs) charge content providers (CPs) for premium
  services beyond best-effort connectivity. Although prioritized peering raises
  concerns about net neutrality, the U.S. FCC exempted peering agreements from
  its recent ruling, as it falls short of background in the Internet peering
  context. In this paper, we consider the premium peering options provided by
  APs and study whether CPs will choose to peer. Based on a novel choice model
  of complementary services, we characterize the market shares and utilities of
  the providers under various peering decisions and identify the value of
  premium peering for the CPs that fundamentally determine CPs' peering
  decisions. We find that high-value CPs have peer pressure when low-value CPs
  peer; however, low-value CPs behave oppositely. The peering decisions of the
  high-value and low-value CPs are substantially influenced by their baseline
  market shares and user stickiness, respectively, but not vice versa.
