abstract: As video streaming services become more popular, users desire high
  perceived video quality, which has placed more stringent requirements on the
  quality of connection. Existing issues of cellular networks encourage users to
  seek alternative connections such as public Wi-Fi networks; however,
  expectations of both users and owners of Wi-Fi networks are not sufficiently
  satisfied and various concerns are yet to be addressed by a better Wi-Fi
  access system. Based on a go-as-you-pay scheme, we design and implement DiFi,
  a per-user-based system with dynamic resource allocation and pricing. DiFi
  offers data burst that accommodates user requirements on the burstiness of
  traffic, in addition to bandwidth. It better caters to the various individual
  requirements of users, and better utilizes the limited network resources for
  the owners. We leverage the blockchain-based smart contract to address
  realistic concerns on decentralized control, privacy and trustiness and our
  implementation is compatible with existing Wi-Fi infrastructures.
