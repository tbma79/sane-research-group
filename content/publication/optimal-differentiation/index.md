abstract: As Internet applications have become more diverse in recent years,
  users having heavy demand for online video services are more willing to pay
  higher prices for better services than light users that mainly use e-mails and
  instant messages. This encourages the Internet service providers (ISPs) to
  explore service differentiation so as to optimize their profits and allocation
  of network resources. Much prior work has focused on the viability of network
  service differentiation by comparing with the case of a single-class service.
  However, the optimal service differentiation for an ISP subject to resource
  constraints has remained unsolved. In this paper, we establish an optimal
  control framework to derive the analytical solution to an ISP's optimal
  service differentiation, i.e., the optimal service qualities and associated
  prices. By analyzing the structures of the solution, we reveal how an ISP
  should adjust the service qualities and prices in order to meet varying
  capacity constraints and users' characteristics. We also obtain the conditions
  under which ISPs have strong incentives to implement service differentiation
  and whether regulators should encourage such practices.
