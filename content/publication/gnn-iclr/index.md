abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for representation
  learning on graph data. However, there is limited understanding on how much
  performance GNNs actually gain from graph data. This paper introduces a
  context-surrounding GNN framework and proposes two smoothness metrics to
  measure the quantity and quality of information obtained from graph data. A
  new, improved GNN model, called CS-GNN, is then devised to improve the use of
  graph information based on the smoothness values of a graph. CS-GNN is shown
  to achieve better performance than existing methods in different types of real
  graphs.
