From Aug. 2015 - Jul. 2020:

He was PhD student and received the Ph.D degree in computer science from National University of Singapore (NUS) in Oct. 2020. 

Research: In his Ph.D. thesis, he developed software systems based on leveraging programmable network data and control planes and demonstrated their benefits in improving the performance of two concrete networking applications: 1) a datacenter application as represented by distributed stream analytics and 2) an Internet application as represented by adaptive bitrate video streaming.
