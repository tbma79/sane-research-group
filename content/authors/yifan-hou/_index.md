Hi! Curently I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, advised by Professor Mrinmaya Sachan. Before ETH Zurich, I got my MPhil degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at CUHK, co-advised by Professor Ming-Chang Yang and Professor James Cheng, and my Bachelor degree in the Advanced Class at HUST.



Previously, I worked with Prof. Richard T. B. Ma as a research intern on the understanding of graph neural networks. The work is published on ICLR 2020 and helps me win the Faculty Outstanding MPhil Thesis Award of CUHK.
